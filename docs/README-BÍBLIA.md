get-community-page-data Edge Function
    â†“ (Single consolidated response)
CommunityFeedWithSidebar (Layout)
    â†“ (Props distribution)
â”Œâ”€ CommunityFeed (Posts)
â””â”€ CommunitySidebar (Sidebar Data)
```

### **Component Hierarchy**
- **Page Level**: `ComunidadePage.tsx` - Data fetching and orchestration
- **Layout Level**: `CommunityFeedWithSidebar.tsx` - Two-column responsive layout
- **Module Level**: `PostCard.tsx`, `CommunitySidebar.tsx` - Focused functionality
- **Atomic Level**: `VoteButtons.tsx`, `PostActionMenu.tsx` - Specific interactions
