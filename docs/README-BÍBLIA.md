# EVIDENS AI Development Bible v6.0

**Version:** 6.0.3 (Canon - Edge Function Stabilization)
**Date:** June 24, 2025
**Purpose:** This document contains the complete, authoritative, and machine-optimized set of rules, architectural models, and implementation directives for the EVIDENS project.

---

## CRITICAL UPDATES v6.0.3

### ðŸ”§ Edge Function Stabilization Complete
- **FIXED**: All Edge Functions now use consistent, reliable simplified pattern
- **STANDARDIZED**: Removed shared utility dependencies causing parameter errors
- **VERIFIED**: Community, Acervo, Analytics, and Homepage functions all operational
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Single proven pattern applied across all Edge Functions
- **ELIMINATED**: Architectural inconsistencies that were causing widespread failures

---

## CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS v6.0.3

### âœ… PHASE 1: INFRASTRUCTURE STABILIZATION - COMPLETED
- **Edge Function Architecture**: âœ… All functions use single reliable pattern
- **Admin Functions**: âœ… All operational with consistent implementation
- **Public Functions**: âœ… Community, Acervo, Homepage all functional
- **Analytics Dashboard**: âœ… Fixed and operational
- **Architectural Consistency**: âœ… Single pattern enforced universally

### ðŸ”„ PHASE 2: THEME COMPLIANCE & VISUAL STANDARDIZATION - READY
- **Admin Components Theme Compliance**: Ready to start
- **Component Audit & Fixes**: Ready for theme application

### ðŸ”„ PHASE 3: 08B COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION - READY
- **User Management Interface**: Backend ready, frontend ready
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Fully operational
- **Tag Management System**: Architecture ready
- **Advanced Moderation Tools**: Foundation complete

---

## PART 3: IMPLEMENTATION DIRECTIVES (CODING ALGORITHMS) - UPDATED v6.0.3

### [D3.5] â€” Security, API, & Edge Functions - FINALIZED v6.0.3

*   **SEC.1 (RLS is Firewall):** All data access is governed by database-level RLS policies. Any new feature requiring data access **MUST** be accompanied by a corresponding migration file that defines its RLS policies. (Source: `[DOC_4]`)
*   **SEC.2 (JWT Claims):** Authorization logic **MUST** rely on JWT custom claims (`role`, `subscription_tier`). Functions that alter a user's role **MUST** also call `supabase.auth.admin.updateUserById()` to update these claims in the token.
*   **SEC.3 (Edge Function Pattern) - CANONICAL SIMPLIFIED PATTERN:** Every Edge Function **MUST** implement the following proven pattern:
    1.  **CORS Preflight**: Handle OPTIONS requests with corsHeaders
    2.  **Client Creation**: Create Supabase client with service role
    3.  **Authentication**: Verify JWT and extract user (when required)
    4.  **Authorization**: Check user role against requirements (when required)
    5.  **Business Logic**: Execute the core function logic
    6.  **Response**: Return structured response with CORS headers
    7.  **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
*   **SEC.4 (Pattern Consistency):** All Edge Functions **MUST** be self-contained with no shared utility dependencies to ensure maximum reliability.
