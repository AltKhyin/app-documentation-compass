[üì∏ VISUAL CHECKPOINT 2]
What to Check: The main application shell on both desktop and mobile. Does the layout switch correctly at the breakpoint? Do the user's name and avatar appear? Does the sidebar collapse?
Goal: Ensure the application's "chrome" is structurally sound before adding detailed styling.

[ ] Task 4.3 (Frontend - Structure): Implement the client-side sorting logic based on tag selection.
[üì∏ VISUAL CHECKPOINT 4]
What to Check: The Acervo page functionality. Does the grid render? Does clicking a tag reorder the items correctly (check the developer console network tab to ensure no new API calls are made)?
Goal: Confirm the complex, client-side reordering logic works before polishing the animation.
[ ] Task 4.4 (Frontend - Polish): Implement the smooth, animated reordering of the MasonryGrid using a library like Framer Motion to prevent a jarring experience. Apply final styling to all cards and tags.
  
Milestone 5: The Community Platform

[ ] Task 5.1 (Frontend - Structure): Build the LayoutAwareRenderer and BlockRenderer components. Implement the core recursive logic to render the structured_content.
[ ] Task 5.2 (Frontend - Structure): Implement the logic for collapsible sections and the lazy-loading of the community thread.
[ ] Task 5.3 (Frontend - Structure): Build the RecommendedSection and its data hook.
[üì∏ VISUAL CHECKPOINT 5]
What to Check: A single Review page. Does the custom layout from the JSON render correctly on both desktop and mobile? Do collapsible sections work? Do the comments lazy-load upon scrolling?
Goal: Ensure the most complex renderer in the application is functionally perfect before styling.


Milestone 6: Practitioner Profiles & Social Features

[ ] Task 6.1 (Backend): Create migrations and RLS policies for all community-related tables.
[ ] Task 6.2 (Backend): Implement the create-community-post, cast-post-vote, and get-community-sidebar-data Edge Functions.

[ ] Task 6.5 (Frontend - Structure): Assemble the /community and /community/[postId] pages.
[üì∏ VISUAL CHECKPOINT 6]
What to Check: The Community page on desktop. Is the two-column layout correct? Does the sidebar fetch and display its data? Does the feed load? Can you vote and post?
Goal: Verify the most complex user-facing page is functionally complete.
[ ] Task 6.6 (Frontend - Polish): Apply final styling to match the screenshot with extreme fidelity. Ensure proper alignment, spacing, and mobile adaptation (e.g., pinned cards for sidebar modules).

[üì∏ VISUAL CHECKPOINT 8]
What to Check: The Admin Editor. Can you create, move, resize, and edit different content blocks? Can you switch between desktop and mobile layouts? Does the "Save" button successfully send the correct JSON payload to the backend?
Goal: This is the most critical checkpoint. The editor must be fully functional before it is styled.
[ ] Task 8.4 (Admin Frontend - Polish): Apply final styling to the entire editor interface to make it a polished and user-friendly tool for the administrative team.


Milestone 9: Moderation & Notification Systems

[ ] Task 10.1 (Backend): Implement the full backend for the Den√∫ncias system and the Notification system as per their blueprints.
